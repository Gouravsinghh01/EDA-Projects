Zomato Restaurant Analytics Dashboard
This project provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard for analyzing Zomato restaurant data. It focuses on key metrics such as restaurant distribution across cities, rating trends, and cuisine popularity. The dashboard allows users to dynamically filter the data and visualize the results, offering valuable insights into the food and beverage industry.

üìÅ Project Structure
zomato.csv: The raw dataset containing detailed information about restaurants.

app.py: The main Python script that runs the Streamlit web application. This file contains all the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization code.

README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

requirements.txt: A list of all necessary Python libraries to run the application.

üöÄ How to Run the App
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or a later version installed on your system.

2. Install Dependencies
First, clone this repository to your local machine.
