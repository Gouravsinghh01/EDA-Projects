Flight Delay Analysis Dashboard
Overview
This is an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit and Python to analyze flight delay data. The application loads a CSV file and presents several key visualizations to help users understand patterns and causes of flight delays. The dashboard includes charts on airline performance, delay causes, monthly trends, and more.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed. You will also need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install streamlit pandas seaborn matplotlib plotly

How to Run
Make sure you have a flights.csv file in the same directory as the application script.

Save the provided Python code as app.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the files are saved, and run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

This will automatically open the dashboard in your default web browser.

Dashboard Sections
The dashboard is structured into several sections, each providing a different perspective on the data:

Data Overview: Displays the shape of the dataset and the first five rows, giving you a quick look at the data structure.

1. Average Arrival Delay by Airline: A bar chart that shows the average arrival delay for each airline, sorted from highest to lowest.

2. Total Delay by Cause: A bar chart that breaks down the total minutes of delay by common causes (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, and Late Aircraft).

3. Average Arrival Delay by Month: A line plot that illustrates the trend of average arrival delays over the months of the year.

4. Top 10 Most Delayed Routes: A horizontal bar chart that highlights the top 10 flight routes with the highest average arrival delays.

5. Arrival Delay Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of arrival delays across all flights, with a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) line to visualize the underlying probability density.
